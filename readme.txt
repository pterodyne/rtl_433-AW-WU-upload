I made this using Gemini 2.5 since I no longer have the base unit for my Ambientweather weatherstation, but the sensors are still working fine.  Use at your own risk. No warranty, no nothing.  It works for me.  Just edit the various variables for your environment.  No license as in NOPL, I don't care what you do with it. In fact don't attribute it to me at all :)

You can see my weatherstation in action here:

Prerequisites:

rtl_433 (for debian sudo apt install rtl-433)
a rtl2832 SDR or similar SDR
Linux/Unix/BSD, bash
ambient weather weatherstation. Mine report as Fineoffset-WH25 (indoor unit, temp/humidity/pressure) and Fineoffset-WH24 (outdoor unit, temp/humidity/wind speed-direction/UV/Rain/Solar radiation.  Other units will likely work but will need some adjustments.  Ask Gemini 2.5!

Good luck.
