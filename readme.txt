I made this using Gemini 2.5 since I no longer have the base unit for my Ambientweather weatherstation, but the sensors are still working fine.  Use at your own risk. No warranty, no nothing.  It works for me.  Just edit the various variables for your environment.  No license as in NOPL, I don't care what you do with it. In fact don't attribute it to me at all :)
